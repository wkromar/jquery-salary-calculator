JQUERY SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
This application is meant to accept information about current employees from the current company and display it in a table. It processes each employees current salary and divides it by 12 to reach a monthly expense to the company.

The problem here was to create a website with more dynamic code: being able to create and display list items to the DOM, delete them, accept data from the user and do some math!

i solved this problem by creating a base function that would react to the clicks of a button and activate functions when they were clicked. I then created individual functions that each had a single job. The first function would add the user information to a table. the next function would store the info that the user input into an array to be used by the first function. It also accepted the math function. The third function cleaned out the holding variable once the information had been passed into the array for storage. the fourth function completed the math and displayed wether the total monthly cost was over budget with a visual indicator. The fifth function would delete an item out of the table when the DELETE button had been pressed
